# Beyond Von Neumann: Architectural Approaches to LLM Security

## Executive Summary

Current Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from prompt injection vulnerabilities that stem from their Von Neumann-like architecture, where instructions and data coexist in the same memory space. This document explores alternative computing architectures and their potential applications to create more secure LLM systems that maintain clear boundaries between system instructions and user input.

## The Von Neumann Vulnerability Problem

### Core Issue
In traditional Von Neumann architecture, both instructions and data are stored in the same memory space and accessed through the same bus. Similarly, current LLMs process system prompts and user input through the same token stream, creating fundamental security vulnerabilities:

- **Instruction-Data Confusion**: User input can be crafted to resemble system instructions
- **Context Pollution**: Malicious prompts can alter the model's behavior by injecting new "rules"
- **Privilege Escalation**: Users can potentially access system-level functions through carefully crafted inputs

### Real-World Impact
- Data exfiltration through prompt manipulation
- Behavioral hijacking of AI assistants
- Bypassing safety constraints and content filters
- Unauthorized access to tool functions and APIs

## Alternative Architectures for Secure LLM Design

### 1. Harvard Architecture Approach

**Traditional Harvard Design**
- Physically separate instruction and data memory
- Independent buses for instruction fetch and data access
- Prevents self-modifying code vulnerabilities

**LLM Implementation: Dual-Stream Processing**

#### Architecture Overview
```
System Instructions Stream    User Input Stream
        ↓                           ↓
   [Instruction                [Data Parser]
    Processor]                      ↓
        ↓                    [Content Filter]
   [Rule Engine] ←—————————→ [Context Builder]
        ↓                           ↓
         ←—————— [Response Generator] ←——————
                        ↓
                  [Output Validator]
```

#### Implementation Details
- **Instruction Memory**: Immutable system prompts, rules, and constraints
- **Data Memory**: User input, conversation history, and dynamic context

- Clear audit trail of instruction vs. data processing
- Natural immunity to many injection techniques
- Simplified security analysis and verification

### 2. Dataflow Architecture Approach

**Traditional Dataflow Design**
- Computation occurs when data becomes available
- No program counter; execution driven by data dependencies
- Inherently parallel and deterministic

**LLM Implementation: Dependency-Driven Processing**

#### Architecture Overview
```
[User Input] → [Sanitizer] → [Intent Classifier]
      ↓              ↓              ↓
[Context DB] → [Relevance Filter] → [Safety Checker]
      ↓              ↓              ↓
[System Rules] → [Permission Gate] → [Response Builder]
      ↓              ↓              ↓
      └————————→ [Final Validator] → [Output]
```

#### Implementation Details
- **Token Availability**: Processing only occurs when required input tokens are present
- **Dependency Chains**: Each processing node has explicit prerequisites
- **Data-Driven Activation**: System functions activate only with proper data provenance

### 3. Neuromorphic Computing Approach

**Traditional Neuromorphic Design**
- Event-driven, spike-based processing
- Parallel neural pathways with specialized functions
- Adaptive but contained learning mechanisms

**LLM Implementation: Multi-Pathway Processing**

#### Architecture Overview
```
Input Layer
     ↓
[Content Type Classifier]
     ↓
┌────────────────┬────────────────┐
│ System Pathway │ User Pathway   │
│ - High priority │ - Standard     │
│ - Privileged    │ - Sandboxed    │
│ - Immutable     │ - Mutable      │
└────────────────┴────────────────┘
     ↓                    ↓
[Privilege Gate] ←—————→ [Safety Filter]
     ↓                    ↓
      └——— [Integration Layer] ———┘
                  ↓
            [Response Output]
```

#### Implementation Details

### 4. Systolic Array Approach

**Traditional Systolic Design**
- Regular array of processing elements
- Synchronized data flow through predictable patterns
- High throughput through parallel computation

**LLM Implementation: Pipeline Processing Grid**

#### Architecture Overview
```
Stage 1: Input Processing Array

## Advanced Implementation Strategies

### Capability-Based Security Framework

Inspired by capability-based computing architectures:

#### Core Components
- **Capability Tokens**: Each input source receives specific capability tokens
- **Privilege Hierarchy**: System instructions require elevated capabilities
- **Token Verification**: All operations checked against capability requirements
- **Capability Revocation**: Dynamic adjustment of permissions based on behavior

#### Implementation Example
```python
class CapabilityToken:
    def __init__(self, source, privileges, constraints):
        self.source = source
        self.privileges = set(privileges)
        self.constraints = constraints
        self.created_at = timestamp()
    
    def can_execute(self, operation):
        return operation in self.privileges and \
               self.meets_constraints(operation)

class SecureLLMProcessor:
    def process_input(self, input_text, capability_token):
        if not capability_token.can_execute("process_user_input"):
            raise PermissionError("Insufficient privileges")
        
        # Process with capability constraints
        return self.constrained_process(input_text, capability_token)
```

### Formal Verification Framework

Mathematical approaches to ensure security properties:

The key insight is architectural: separating instructions from data at the system level, rather than relying solely on prompt engineering or content filtering. While implementation challenges exist, the security benefits of these approaches could be transformative for deploying LLMs in high-stakes environments.

Future work should focus on practical implementations that balance security, performance, and usability while maintaining the remarkable capabilities that make LLMs so valuable. The path forward requires collaboration between computer architecture experts, AI safety researchers, and systems engineers to create the next generation of secure artificial intelligence systems.
