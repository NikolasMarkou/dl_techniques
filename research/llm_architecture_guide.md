## Introduction

The landscape of Large Language Models has evolved rapidly since the introduction of the Transformer architecture. While the fundamental transformer block remains the backbone of most LLMs, modern architectures incorporate various optimizations and innovations to improve efficiency, capability, and scalability.

This guide examines six representative models that showcase the current state of LLM architecture design:
- **Dense Models**: Llama 3.2 1B, Qwen3 4B, SmolLM3 3B
- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Models**: DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 235B-A22B, Kimi K2

## Fundamental Architecture Components

### Attention Mechanisms

#### Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
The original attention mechanism where each head has its own query, key, and value projections. Provides maximum expressiveness but at the cost of memory and computation.

#### Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)
An optimization where multiple query heads share the same key and value projections, reducing memory usage and improving inference efficiency while maintaining most of the modeling capability.

#### Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)
A newer approach that compresses key and value tensors into lower-dimensional representations before storing them in the KV cache, then projects them back during computation.

### Positional Encoding

#### RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)
Encodes positional information by rotating query and key vectors based on their absolute positions, enabling better length generalization.

#### NoPE (No Positional Embeddings)
Removes explicit positional encoding, relying on causal masking and learned patterns to understand sequence order.

### Normalization Strategies

#### RMSNorm
A simplified version of LayerNorm that only normalizes by the root mean square, reducing computational overhead.

#### Pre-Norm vs Post-Norm
- **Pre-Norm**: Applies normalization before attention/FFN layers (better gradient flow)
- **Post-Norm**: Applies normalization after attention/FFN layers (original transformer design)

### Feed-Forward Networks

#### Standard FFN
Traditional two-layer MLP with activation function (typically GELU or SwiGLU).

#### Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
Replaces single FFN with multiple expert networks, routing each token to a subset of experts for increased model capacity with controlled computational cost.
