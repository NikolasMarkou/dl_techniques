## Fundamentals of Normalization

### Why Normalize?
1. **Numerical Stability**
   - Controls scale of activations and gradients during backpropagation
   - Prevents exploding/vanishing gradients
   - Makes training more stable across deep architectures

2. **Optimization Benefits**
   - Faster convergence in training
   - Reduced burden on first layer weights
   - Better interaction with optimization algorithms

3. **Initialization Compatibility**
   - Aligns with common weight initialization schemes (Xavier/Glorot, He)
   - Ensures stable training from the start
   - Maintains consistent variance across layers

## Normalization Approaches

### 1. Zero-Centered Normalization (-1 to +1)
```python
normalized = (pixel - 127.5) / 127.5
```
**Advantages:**
- Zero-centered distribution
- Sufficient dynamic range
- Simple implementation
- Works well with common activation functions
- Industry standard for many applications

### 2. Standard [0, 1] Normalization
```python
normalized = pixel / 255.0
```
**Considerations:**
- Non-zero mean (typically 0.4-0.5 for natural images)
- May introduce slight positive bias
- Simpler but potentially suboptimal for deep networks

### 3. Mean/Std Normalization
```python
# Common ImageNet normalization values
mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]  # RGB channels
std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]   # RGB channels
normalized = (pixel / 255.0 - mean) / std
```
**Benefits:**
- Channel-wise standardization
- Approximates N(0,1) distribution
- Standard for pre-trained models

## Best Practices

### General Guidelines

1. **Default Choice**
   - Use [-1, +1] normalization as the standard default
   - Provides good balance of simplicity and effectiveness
   - Works well across different architectures and tasks

2. **Architecture-Specific Considerations**
   - For pre-trained models: Follow their specific normalization scheme
   - For transfer learning: Match the original model's normalization
   - For custom models: Zero-centered normalization is recommended

3. **Data Type Considerations**
   - For 8-bit images: Scale from [0, 255] to target range
   - For 16-bit images: Adjust scaling factor accordingly
   - For floating-point inputs: Ensure proper scaling to target range

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Examples

1. **Basic [-1, +1] Normalization**
```python
def normalize_minus1_1(image: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Normalize image to [-1, +1] range.
    
    Args:
        image: Input image array with values in [0, 255]
        
    Returns:
        Normalized image array with values in [-1, +1]
    """
    return (image - 127.5) / 127.5
```

2. **ImageNet-style Normalization**
```python
def normalize_imagenet(
    image: np.ndarray,
    mean: List[float] = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
    std: List[float] = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Apply ImageNet-style normalization.
    
    Args:
        image: Input image array with values in [0, 255]
        mean: Channel-wise mean values
        std: Channel-wise standard deviation values
        
    Returns:
        Normalized image array
    """
    normalized = image / 255.0
    normalized = (normalized - mean) / std
    return normalized
```

## Special Considerations

### 1. Batch Normalization Interaction
- Zero-centered inputs work better with BatchNorm
- Consider the entire normalization pipeline in the network
- Maintain consistent normalization throughout training and inference

### 2. Activation Functions
- ReLU/LeakyReLU: Benefit from zero-centered inputs
- Tanh: Natural range of [-1, +1] aligns well
- Sigmoid: Consider input distribution carefully

### 3. Performance Impact
- Cache normalized values when possible
- Consider hardware acceleration for normalization
- Balance precision with computational efficiency

## Conclusion

The recommended default approach is to normalize inputs to [-1, +1] range because it:
1. Provides zero-centered distribution
2. Offers sufficient dynamic range
3. Is simple to implement and maintain
4. Works well with modern architectures and optimization techniques

For specific architectures or pre-trained models, always consult the original implementation's normalization scheme and match it exactly.
