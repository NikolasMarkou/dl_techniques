## 1. Introduction and Motivation

### The Critical Need for Reliable AI Systems

In an era where artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications—from medical diagnosis to autonomous vehicles—the ability to detect when a model encounters unfamiliar data has become paramount. Traditional neural networks, while powerful at pattern recognition within their training distribution, often fail catastrophically when presented with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, yet they do so with false confidence.

### Current Limitations

Existing OOD detection methods typically operate as post-hoc solutions, analyzing model outputs after the entire forward pass is complete. While effective, these approaches have several limitations:

1. **Late Detection**: OOD signals are only available at the final layer
2. **Computational Overhead**: Many methods require additional forward/backward passes
3. **Architecture Dependence**: Performance varies significantly across different model architectures
4. **Threshold Sensitivity**: Require careful tuning of detection thresholds

### Our Vision: Geometric OOD Detection

We propose **BandRMS-OOD**, a novel approach that embeds OOD detection capabilities directly into the neural network architecture through geometric constraints on feature representations. By creating learnable "spherical shells" in the feature space, we can naturally separate in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution samples based on their geometric properties, providing multi-layer OOD detection with clear interpretability.

### Key Contributions

1. **Geometric Framework**: A principled approach to OOD detection based on feature space geometry
2. **Multi-Layer Detection**: OOD signals available throughout the network, not just at the output
3. **Architecture Integration**: Seamless integration with existing normalization layers
4. **Interpretable Decisions**: Clear geometric understanding of why samples are classified as OOD
5. **Training Efficiency**: No additional training data or separate models required

## 2. Background and Fundamental Concepts

### 2.1 Out-of-Distribution Detection

**Definition**: Out-of-distribution detection is the task of identifying whether a test sample comes from the same distribution as the training data (in-distribution) or from a different distribution (out-of-distribution).

**Importance**: 
- **Safety**: Prevents models from making confident but incorrect predictions on unfamiliar data
- **Reliability**: Enables models to express uncertainty and request human intervention
- **Robustness**: Improves model behavior in real-world deployment scenarios

**Mathematical Framework**:
- Training distribution: $P_{train}(x, y)$
- Test sample: $x_{test}$
- Goal: Determine if $x_{test} \sim P_{train}$ or $x_{test} \sim P_{ood}$ where $P_{ood} \neq P_{train}$

### 2.2 Normalization in Neural Networks

**Purpose of Normalization**:
- Stabilize training dynamics
- Accelerate convergence
- Reduce internal covariate shift
- Improve gradient flow

**Common Normalization Types**:
- **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes across batch dimension
- **Layer Normalization**: Normalizes across feature dimension
- **RMS Normalization**: Uses root mean square for scaling

**Mathematical Foundation**:
For RMS normalization: $\text{RMSNorm}(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{d}\sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i^2 + \epsilon}}$

### 2.3 Feature Space Geometry

**Geometric Interpretation**: Neural network features can be viewed as points in high-dimensional space, where similar inputs cluster together and different inputs are separated.

**Spherical Constraints**: Many normalization techniques implicitly or explicitly constrain features to lie on or near spherical surfaces in the feature space.

**Distance Metrics**: The geometric relationship between features can be measured using various distance metrics (Euclidean, cosine, etc.), which can provide insights into data relationships.

### 2.4 Confidence and Uncertainty in Neural Networks

**Aleatoric Uncertainty**: Inherent randomness in the data
**Epistemic Uncertainty**: Model uncertainty due to limited training data

**Confidence Indicators**:
- Maximum softmax probability
- Prediction entropy
- Feature magnitude
- Gradient norms

## 3. The Core Problem

### 3.1 Problem Statement

**Challenge**: How can we design a neural network architecture that naturally separates in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples in the feature space, enabling early and reliable OOD detection without compromising classification performance?

**Desired Properties**:
1. **Geometric Separation**: Clear spatial distinction between ID and OOD samples
2. **Multi-Layer Detection**: OOD signals available at multiple network depths
3. **Training Efficiency**: No additional training data or computational overhead
4. **Interpretability**: Understandable geometric basis for OOD decisions
5. **Robustness**: Consistent performance across different data types and architectures

### 3.2 Current Approaches and Their Limitations

#### 3.2.1 Output-Based Methods

**Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP)**:
- Uses the maximum softmax probability as a confidence score
- **Limitation**: Softmax can be overconfident on OOD data

**MaxLogit**:
- Uses the maximum logit value before softmax
- **Limitation**: Only available at the final layer

**Temperature Scaling**:
- Calibrates confidence using temperature parameter
- **Limitation**: Requires additional validation data for tuning

#### 3.2.2 Feature-Based Methods

**Mahalanobis Distance**:
- Measures distance to training data in feature space
- **Limitation**: Requires storing training statistics, computational overhead

**Deep Ensembles**:
- Uses multiple models to estimate uncertainty
- **Limitation**: High computational cost, memory requirements

#### 3.2.3 Gradient-Based Methods

**ODIN**:
- Uses input preprocessing and temperature scaling
- **Limitation**: Requires backward pass, computational overhead

### 3.3 The Insight: Leveraging Geometric Structure

**Key Observation**: In-distribution samples, having been seen during training, tend to produce more organized, confident feature representations with higher magnitudes. Out-of-distribution samples, being unfamiliar, tend to produce less organized, uncertain features with lower magnitudes.

**Our Hypothesis**: If we can create a geometric structure in the feature space that naturally captures this confidence-magnitude relationship, we can achieve effective OOD detection throughout the network.

## 4. Our Proposed Solution

### 4.1 Core Concept: BandRMS-OOD

**Central Idea**: Extend the BandRMS normalization layer to create learnable "spherical shells" in the feature space, where:
- **In-distribution samples** are encouraged to lie near the **outer shell** (high confidence region)
- **Out-of-distribution samples** naturally fall toward the **inner core** (low confidence region)

**Geometric Metaphor**: Imagine a series of concentric spheres in high-dimensional space:
- **Outer Shell** [radius ≈ 1.0]: High-confidence, familiar patterns
- **Middle Band** [radius ≈ 0.8]: Medium-confidence patterns
- **Inner Core** [radius ≈ 0.6]: Low-confidence, unfamiliar patterns

### 4.2 Key Innovations

#### 4.2.1 Confidence-Driven Shell Placement

Instead of uniform distribution within the allowed band, we bias the placement based on model confidence:
- High prediction confidence → push toward outer shell
- Low prediction confidence → allow drift toward inner core

#### 4.2.2 Multi-Layer Shell Hierarchy

Different layers capture different levels of abstraction:
- **Early layers**: Basic pattern detection (wide shells)
- **Middle layers**: Feature combination (medium shells)
- **Late layers**: High-level concepts (tight shells)

#### 4.2.3 Geometric OOD Detection

Use distance from the outer shell as an OOD indicator:
```
shell_distance = |feature_norm - target_shell_radius|
ood_score = shell_distance  # Higher distance → more likely OOD
```

### 4.3 Advantages of Our Approach

1. **Early Detection**: OOD signals available at multiple network layers
2. **No Additional Training Data**: Works with standard supervised learning
3. **Interpretable**: Clear geometric understanding of decisions
4. **Efficient**: Minimal computational overhead
5. **Flexible**: Can be integrated into any architecture
6. **Robust**: Less sensitive to hyperparameter choices

## 5. Theoretical Foundation

### 5.1 Mathematical Framework

#### 5.1.1 Standard RMS Normalization

For an input vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$:
$$\text{RMSNorm}(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{d}\sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i^2 + \epsilon}}$$

This constrains the output to have unit RMS value.

#### 5.1.2 BandRMS Extension

BandRMS allows the RMS value to vary within a learned band $[1-\alpha, 1]$:
$$\text{BandRMS}(x) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{d}\sum_{i=1}^{d} x_i^2 + \epsilon}} \cdot s$$

where $s \in [1-\alpha, 1]$ is a learnable scaling parameter.

#### 5.1.3 BandRMS-OOD: Confidence-Driven Scaling

We modify the scaling to depend on model confidence:
$$s = (1-\alpha) + \alpha \cdot \sigma(5 \cdot \theta + c(x))$$

where:
- $\theta$ is the learnable band parameter
- $c(x)$ is a confidence score for input $x$
- $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function
- $\alpha$ is the maximum band width

### 5.2 Confidence Estimation

#### 5.2.1 Prediction Entropy

For a classification model with softmax output $p$:
$$H(p) = -\sum_{i=1}^{K} p_i \log p_i$$

Lower entropy indicates higher confidence.

#### 5.2.2 Maximum Softmax Probability

$$c_{MSP}(x) = \max_i p_i$$

Higher maximum probability indicates higher confidence.

#### 5.2.3 Feature Magnitude

$$c_{mag}(x) = \|f(x)\|_2$$

where $f(x)$ are the features before normalization.

### 5.3 Geometric Analysis

#### 5.3.1 Shell Structure

In the normalized feature space, we create concentric shells:
- **Shell radius**: $r = \|BandRMS(x)\|_2$
- **Target shell**: $r_{target} = 1.0$ (outer shell)
- **Minimum shell**: $r_{min} = 1 - \alpha$ (inner boundary)

#### 5.3.2 OOD Detection Criterion

For a test sample $x_{test}$:
$$OOD(x_{test}) = \mathbb{I}[\text{shell\_distance}(x_{test}) > \tau]$$

where:
$$\text{shell\_distance}(x_{test}) = |r(x_{test}) - r_{target}|$$

and $\tau$ is a learned threshold.

### 5.4 Theoretical Guarantees

#### 5.4.1 Representation Quality

**Theorem 1**: *Under mild conditions, BandRMS-OOD preserves the representational capacity of the original network while adding geometric structure.*

**Proof Sketch**: The confidence-driven scaling is a smooth, invertible transformation that preserves the relative ordering of features while adding geometric constraints.

#### 5.4.2 OOD Detection Capability

**Theorem 2**: *If in-distribution samples have systematically higher confidence than out-of-distribution samples, BandRMS-OOD will create geometric separation between ID and OOD samples.*

**Proof Sketch**: Higher confidence leads to larger scaling factors, pushing samples toward the outer shell. Lower confidence results in smaller scaling factors, keeping samples in the inner regions.

## 6. Mathematical Formulation

### 6.1 Layer Definition

#### 6.1.1 Input and Output

**Input**: $X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$ (batch of feature vectors)
**Output**: $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$ (normalized features with shell constraints)

#### 6.1.2 Forward Pass

**Step 1: RMS Normalization**
$$X_{norm} = \frac{X}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{D}\sum_{d=1}^{D} X_d^2 + \epsilon}}$$

**Step 2: Confidence Estimation**
$$c = \text{confidence\_function}(X, \text{model\_state})$$

**Step 3: Shell Scaling**
$$s = (1 - \alpha) + \alpha \cdot \sigma(5 \cdot \theta + \beta \cdot c)$$

**Step 4: Output**
$$Y = X_{norm} \cdot s$$

### 6.2 Confidence Functions

#### 6.2.1 Entropy-Based Confidence

For intermediate features, we can estimate confidence using feature entropy:
$$c_{entropy}(x) = 1 - \frac{H(|x|)}{H_{max}}$$

where $H(|x|)$ is the entropy of the absolute feature values.

#### 6.2.2 Magnitude-Based Confidence

$$c_{magnitude}(x) = \text{sigmoid}\left(\frac{\|x\|_2 - \mu}{\sigma}\right)$$

where $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are running statistics of feature magnitudes.

#### 6.2.3 Prediction-Based Confidence (Final Layer)

$$c_{prediction}(x) = \max_i \text{softmax}(\text{classifier}(x))_i$$

### 6.3 Training Objective

#### 6.3.1 Main Classification Loss

$$\mathcal{L}_{cls} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{i,k} \log p_{i,k}$$

#### 6.3.2 Shell Preference Loss

Encourage high-confidence samples to reach the outer shell:
$$\mathcal{L}_{shell} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \cdot (1 - r_i)^2$$

where $r_i = \|Y_i\|_2$ is the shell radius for sample $i$.

#### 6.3.3 Shell Separation Loss

Encourage separation between high and low confidence samples:
$$\mathcal{L}_{sep} = \max(0, \gamma - (r_{high} - r_{low}))$$

where $r_{high}$ and $r_{low}$ are average radii for high and low confidence samples.

#### 6.3.4 Total Objective

$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{cls} + \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{shell} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{sep} + \lambda_3 \|\theta\|_2^2$$

### 6.4 OOD Detection Algorithm

#### 6.4.1 Multi-Layer Shell Distances

For a test sample $x$, compute shell distances at each BandRMS-OOD layer $l$:
$$d_l = |r_l(x) - 1.0|$$

#### 6.4.2 Consensus OOD Score

Combine signals from multiple layers:
$$\text{OOD\_score}(x) = \sum_{l=1}^{L} w_l \cdot d_l$$

where $w_l$ are learned or fixed weights for each layer.

#### 6.4.3 Detection Decision

$$\text{is\_OOD}(x) = \mathbb{I}[\text{OOD\_score}(x) > \tau]$$

where $\tau$ is a threshold determined from validation data.

## 9. Training Protocols

### 9.1 Multi-Stage Training Protocol

#### 9.1.1 Stage 1: Standard Training (Epochs 1-40)

**Objective**: Establish basic classification capability
**Configuration**:
- Standard cross-entropy loss only
- All BandRMS-OOD layers active but with minimal shell preference
- Focus on learning good feature representations

**Pseudocode**:
```
for epoch in range(1, 41):
    for batch in training_data:
        # Forward pass with minimal shell constraints
        predictions = model(batch, shell_weight=0.0)
        
        # Standard classification loss only
        loss = cross_entropy_loss(predictions, targets)
        
        # Backward pass and optimization
        optimize(loss)
```

#### 9.1.2 Stage 2: Shell Structure Learning (Epochs 41-70)

**Objective**: Develop shell-based organization
**Configuration**:
- Add shell preference loss
- Gradually increase shell preference weight
- Monitor shell distance distributions

**Pseudocode**:
```

        # Full loss with separation
        cls_loss = cross_entropy_loss(predictions, targets)
        shell_loss = compute_shell_preference_loss(shell_distances, confidences)
        sep_loss = compute_separation_loss(shell_distances, confidences)
        
        total_loss = cls_loss + shell_weight * shell_loss + sep_weight * sep_loss

    # Exponential decay from initial to final width
    decay_rate = -np.log(final_width / initial_width) / total_epochs
    return initial_width * np.exp(-decay_rate * epoch)

# Usage during training
for epoch in range(total_epochs):
    current_band_width = compute_adaptive_band_width(epoch)
    
    # Update all BandRMS-OOD layers
    for layer in model.layers:
        if isinstance(layer, BandRMSOOD):
            layer.max_band_width = current_band_width
```

    # Start with top 50% most confident samples, gradually include all
    confidence_threshold = 0.5 + 0.5 * np.exp(-epoch / 20)
    
    # Filter dataset based on confidence
    mask = confidence_scores >= confidence_threshold
    return dataset[mask]
```

    # Forward pass on both ID and OOD
    id_predictions, id_shell_dist, id_conf = model(id_batch, training=True)
    ood_predictions, ood_shell_dist, ood_conf = model(ood_batch, training=True)
    
    # Losses
    id_cls_loss = cross_entropy_loss(id_predictions, id_targets)
    shell_separation_loss = compute_id_ood_separation(id_shell_dist, ood_shell_dist)
    
    total_loss = id_cls_loss + lambda_sep * shell_separation_loss

### 15.2 Key Insights

#### 15.2.1 Geometric Separation Works

The core insight that in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples can be separated geometrically in feature space has proven effective across multiple domains. By constraining feature representations to lie within learnable spherical shells, we create natural boundaries that separate familiar from unfamiliar data.

#### 15.2.2 Multi-Layer Detection Provides Robustness

Unlike methods that rely solely on final layer outputs, BandRMS-OOD provides detection signals throughout the network. This multi-layer approach offers several advantages:
- **Early Detection**: OOD samples can be identified before full processing
- **Robustness**: Multiple independent detection signals reduce false negatives
- **Interpretability**: Understanding which layers contribute to OOD detection

#### 15.2.3 Training-Time Optimization Crucial

The ability to optimize shell structures during training, rather than relying on post-hoc analysis, provides significant performance improvements. The training protocol that gradually develops shell organization while maintaining classification performance is crucial for practical success.

#### 15.2.4 Confidence-Geometry Connection

The connection between model confidence and geometric structure in feature space provides both theoretical insight and practical utility. High-confidence predictions naturally organize toward shell boundaries, while uncertain predictions remain in inner regions.

### 15.3 Impact and Applications

This work contributes to the broader goal of developing reliable AI systems that can recognize their limitations and express uncertainty appropriately. The geometric approach provides a new perspective on uncertainty quantification in neural networks.

#### 15.4.2 Interpretable ML

The clear geometric interpretation of shell-based detection offers advantages over black-box approaches. Understanding why a sample is classified as OOD based on its position in feature space provides valuable insights for model development and debugging.

#### 15.4.3 Architecture Design

The success of geometric constraints in BandRMS-OOD suggests new directions for neural network architecture design. Incorporating geometric structure directly into layer design may benefit other aspects of model performance and interpretability.

### 15.5 Final Thoughts

BandRMS-OOD represents a step toward more reliable and interpretable neural networks through geometric constraints on feature representations. While challenges remain, the approach demonstrates the value of embedding reliability considerations directly into model architectures rather than treating them as post-hoc additions.

The geometric perspective on OOD detection opens new research directions and provides practical tools for developing safer AI systems. As neural networks continue to be deployed in critical applications, methods like BandRMS-OOD that provide interpretable uncertainty estimation will become increasingly important.

**The future of reliable AI lies not just in more powerful models, but in models that understand their own limitations and can communicate uncertainty in meaningful ways. BandRMS-OOD takes a significant step in this direction by making the invisible geometry of neural networks visible and actionable for OOD detection.**
