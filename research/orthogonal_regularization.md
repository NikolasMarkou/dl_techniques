# Orthonormal Regularization in Neural Networks with Normalization Layers

## 1. The Problem: L2 Regularization and Normalization Layers

### 1.1 Standard Configuration

In modern deep neural networks, a common architectural pattern is:

```
Conv2D → BatchNormalization → Activation
```

With L2 regularization applied to the weights of Conv2D:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}} + \lambda \sum_{w \in \mathcal{W}} \|w\|_2^2$$

### 1.2 Mathematical Contradiction

This combination creates a peculiar mathematical contradiction:

1. **L2 Regularization Effect**: During training, L2 regularization adds the term $2\lambda w$ to the gradient, constantly pushing weights toward zero.

2. **Batch Normalization Operation**:
   $$\hat{x} = \frac{x - \mathbb{E}[x]}{\sqrt{\text{Var}[x] + \epsilon}} \cdot \gamma + \beta$$

3. **The Contradiction**: As weights $W$ decrease in magnitude due to L2 regularization, batch normalization compensates by adjusting its $\gamma$ parameter. The network can maintain identical functional behavior even as weights continuously shrink.

### 1.3 Theoretical Analysis

Let's analyze what happens with a scaling factor $\alpha$ applied to weights $W$:

$$W' = \alpha W$$

For the pre-normalization outputs:
$$z' = W' * x = \alpha (W * x) = \alpha z$$

After batch normalization:
$$\hat{z}' = \frac{\alpha z - \alpha\mu_z}{\sqrt{\alpha^2\sigma_z^2 + \epsilon}} \gamma + \beta = \frac{z - \mu_z}{\sqrt{\sigma_z^2 + \epsilon/\alpha^2}} \gamma + \beta$$

As $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ due to L2 regularization:
- The weights continue to decay toward zero
- BatchNorm's $\gamma$ increases to compensate
- The effective transformation remains unchanged

This creates a system where:
- Regularization continuously pulls weights down
- Normalization parameters continuously scale up
- Training becomes inefficient
- The model may become numerically unstable with extremely small weights

## 2. Orthonormal Regularization: A Mathematical Alternative

### 2.1 Orthonormality Definition

For a weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, orthonormality requires:

$$W W^T = I_m$$

Where $I_m$ is the $m \times m$ identity matrix. This enforces:
1. Each row of $W$ has unit norm
2. Different rows are orthogonal to each other

### 2.2 Regularization Formulation

Orthonormal regularization can be formulated as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{ortho}} = \|W W^T - I\|_F^2$$

Where $\|\cdot\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm.

For convolutional layers, we reshape the 4D tensor $(k_h, k_w, c_{in}, c_{out})$ to a 2D matrix with shape $(c_{out}, k_h \times k_w \times c_{in})$.

### 2.3 Gradient Analysis

The gradient of the orthonormal regularization term is:

$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{\text{ortho}}}{\partial W} = 2W(W^T W - I)$$

This gradient pushes $W$ toward an orthonormal configuration, rather than toward zero.

### 2.4 Mathematical Benefits

1. **Stable Weight Magnitude**: No continuous shrinkage, eliminating the contradiction with normalization
2. **Improved Conditioning**: The condition number of orthogonal matrices is 1, optimizing gradient flow
3. **Preservation of Input Geometry**: Orthonormal transformations preserve angles and distances
4. **Feature Diversity**: Each filter extracts maximally independent features
5. **Efficient Parameter Usage**: Reduces redundancy in learned representations

## 3. Theoretical Comparison: L2 vs. Orthonormal Regularization

| Property | L2 Regularization | Orthonormal Regularization |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Effect on Weights | Continuous decay toward zero | Maintained unit norm with orthogonality |
| Interaction with Normalization | Creates inefficient tug-of-war | Complementary relationship |
| Impact on Gradients | Can lead to smaller gradients | Helps maintain gradient magnitude |
| Feature Extraction | May lead to redundant features | Encourages diverse feature extraction |
| Model Capacity | Effectively reduces capacity | Maintains capacity while improving structure |
| Numerical Stability | Can lead to very small weights | Weights remain well-conditioned |

### 4.4 Complex Layers with Orthonormal Regularization

    """

    def __init__(
        self,

        activation: str = 'relu',
        ortho_factor: float = 0.01,
        **kwargs
    ):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        # Store configuration for build method
        self.filters = filters

        self.norm_type = norm_type
        self.activation_type = activation
        self.ortho_factor = ortho_factor
        
        # These will be initialized in build()
        self.conv = None
        self.norm = None
        self.activation = None
    
    def build(self, input_shape: tf.TensorShape) -> None:
        """
        Create the sublayers when the layer is built.
        """
        # Create convolutional layer
        self.conv = OrthonormalConv2D(

            ortho_factor=self.ortho_factor,
            use_bias=False if self.norm_type else True
        )
        
        # Create normalization layer
        if self.norm_type == 'batch':
            self.norm = layers.BatchNormalization()
        elif self.norm_type == 'layer':
            self.norm = layers.LayerNormalization()
        else:

        super().build(input_shape)
```

## 5. Practical Considerations

### 5.1 Hyperparameter Selection

The orthonormal regularization strength (`ortho_factor`) typically ranges from 0.001 to 0.1:
- Too small: Minimal effect on enforcing orthonormality
- Too large: May interfere with the main task optimization

### 5.2 Computational Considerations

Orthonormal regularization has a higher computational cost than L2 regularization:
- L2: Simple scalar multiplication and addition
- Orthonormal: Matrix multiplication and Frobenius norm

However, this extra cost is often negligible compared to the forward and backward passes through the convolutional layers.

### 5.3 Compatibility

Orthonormal regularization works well with:
- Convolutional layers
- Fully connected layers
- Various normalization schemes (Batch, Layer, Group)
- Different activation functions

### 5.4 Monitoring Implementation

To verify the effect of orthonormal regularization, monitor:
1. The orthogonality measure: $\|W W^T - I\|_F^2$ should decrease during training
2. Weight magnitudes: Should stabilize rather than continuously shrink
3. Singular values of weight matrices: Should become more uniform

## 6. Empirical Observations

When comparing L2 vs. orthonormal regularization with batch normalization:

1. **Weight Evolution**: 
   - L2: Weights continuously decrease in magnitude
   - Orthonormal: Weights stabilize at unit norm

2. **Normalization Parameters**:
   - L2: BatchNorm's γ parameters tend to increase to compensate
   - Orthonormal: BatchNorm's γ parameters remain more stable

3. **Training Dynamics**:
   - L2: May require careful learning rate scheduling as weights shrink
   - Orthonormal: Often exhibits more stable training

4. **Generalization**:
   - Both approaches can improve generalization
   - Orthonormal regularization often shows advantages in scenarios involving sequential processing or deep architectures

## 7. Conclusion

Orthonormal regularization provides a mathematically coherent alternative to L2 regularization when using normalization layers, addressing the contradiction between weight decay and normalization compensation. By encouraging filters to be orthogonal rather than small, it promotes:

1. More efficient parameter usage
2. Better numerical stability
3. Improved gradient flow
4. Diverse feature extraction

The implementation in TensorFlow/Keras requires:
1. A custom regularizer that calculates the orthonormality penalty
2. Proper reshaping of convolutional weights
3. Optional orthogonal initialization to accelerate convergence

This approach offers a principled solution to the theoretical issue you identified, while maintaining the benefits of regularization for improved generalization.

# Literature Review

Below is a curated selection of papers (from the last 30 years) that either:

1. **Directly discuss** or **theoretically analyze** orthogonal/orthonormal constraints in neural networks (some of them also note the tension between weight decay and normalization).
2. **Empirically explore** orthogonality/orthonormality with results showing benefits, drawbacks, or mixed outcomes.
3. **Indirectly support** the idea by examining how scaling invariances (as with batch normalization) can undermine classic L2 regularization—thereby motivating alternative constraints such as orthonormal regularization.

At the end, you will find them in a convenient Markdown list.

## Key Areas in the Literature

1. **Orthogonality / Orthonormality in Neural Networks**  
   - Many papers introduce orthogonal (or unitary) constraints to stabilize training (especially in RNNs) or improve conditioning in CNNs and MLPs.  
   - Some works specifically highlight the *tug-of-war* between scale-based regularizers (like L2) and normalization layers (BN, LN, etc.).

2. **Normalization Layers & Scaling Invariance**  
   - Research on batch normalization (BN) has shown that simply pushing weights toward zero (as with L2) can be offset by BN’s learnable scale parameter γ.  
   - This scaling invariance has inspired alternative regularization techniques (e.g., spectral norm, orthogonality constraints) that better control geometry rather than just magnitude.

3. **Positive vs. Negative (or Mixed) Results**  
   - *Positive*: Many studies report better generalization, more stable gradients, or improved robustness when using orthonormal (or orthogonal) constraints.  
   - *Negative / Mixed*: Some papers show that strictly enforcing orthogonality can slow down convergence or might underperform in certain tasks if not tuned carefully. In practice, partial or “soft” orthogonal constraints often work best.

**Note**:  
- For a deeper look into the “contradiction” between weight decay and BN, many researchers have informally discussed it in blogs and open-source code. However, the more formal arguments appear as side notes in the above and related papers on normalization/orthogonality.  
- Some of these works do not *explicitly* label their method as “orthonormal regularization” but do impose near-orthogonal or unitary constraints—functionally aligning with your proposal.
