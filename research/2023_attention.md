Of course. Let's elevate the previous answer into a comprehensive, implementation-focused guide with the "tiny details" and references you're looking for. This breakdown will cover the exact regularization schemes for both the Attention and FFN sub-layers, typical hyperparameter values, and the reasoning behind each choice, all within the Keras 3 framework.

### Part 1: Architectural Blueprint - The Pre-LN Transformer Block

The fundamental design is a **Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN)** block. This structure is paramount for training stability in very deep networks.

The flow for each sub-layer (MHA and FFN) follows this precise pattern:
`output = x + StochasticDepth(SubLayer(LayerNormalization(x)))`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input: x] --> B(Add);
    subgraph Attention Sub-Layer
        A_res[x] --> C(LayerNormalization);
        C --> D{Multi-Head Attention};
        D --> D_reg(StochasticDepth);
    end
    A_res -- Residual Connection --> B;
    D_reg --> B;

    B --> E[Intermediate: x'];
    E --> F(Add);
    subgraph FFN Sub-Layer
        E_res[x'] --> G(LayerNormalization);
        G --> H{Position-wise FFN};
        H --> H_reg(StochasticDepth);
    end
    E_res -- Residual Connection --> F;
    H_reg --> F;
    F --> I[Output];
```

### Part 2: Deep Dive - The Multi-Head Attention (MHA) Sub-Layer

#### **1. Linear Projections (Q, K, V)**

*   **Implementation:** A single `keras.layers.Dense` layer projects the input `d_model` into a `3 * d_model` dimension, which is then split to form Q, K, and V. This is more computationally efficient than three separate `Dense` layers as it leverages a single, larger matrix multiplication.
*   **The "No Bias" Rule:** The `use_bias` parameter is set to `False`.
    *   **Reason:** The subsequent `LayerNormalization` layer has its own learnable bias parameter (`beta`). This makes the bias in the `Dense` layer mathematically redundant. Removing it saves parameters and simplifies the model.
*   **Weight Initialization:** Keras's default `glorot_uniform` (Xavier) or `he_normal` initializers are standard and work well.

#### **2. Attention Calculation and Regularization**

*   **Scaling:** The `QKáµ€` dot product is scaled by `1 / sqrt(head_dim)`. This is not a regularizer but a critical stabilization technique to prevent the softmax input from having excessively large variance.
*   **Attention Dropout:**
    *   **What:** A `keras.layers.Dropout` is applied directly to the attention weights *after* the softmax operation.
    *   **How Much?** This is a key hyperparameter.
        *   **Typical Value:** `0.1` is a very common default for training medium-to-large models.
        *   **Range:** It can range from `0.0` (no dropout) to `0.2`. For extremely large models (e.g., 100B+ parameters), which are less prone to overfitting, or during fine-tuning, this is often set to `0.0`.
    *   **Purpose:** Prevents the model from becoming over-reliant on a few specific tokens for its context. It forces a "flatter" attention distribution, improving generalization.

---

### Part 3: Deep Dive - The Position-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN) Sub-Layer

This sub-layer is where the model performs most of its non-linear processing and is a critical component for model capacity.

#### **1. Structure and Expansion**

*   **Core Structure:** Two linear layers with a non-linear activation function in between.
*   **Expansion Factor:** The first `Dense` layer expands the dimensionality.
    *   **Standard Practice:** The intermediate dimension is `4 * d_model`. For example, a model with `d_model=768` will have an FFN intermediate dimension of `3072`.
    *   **Reason:** This projects the token representations into a much higher-dimensional space, allowing the model to learn more complex and separable functions before projecting back down to `d_model`.
*   **The "No Bias" Rule:** Just like in the MHA layer, `use_bias=False` is standard practice for both `Dense` layers in the FFN, as they are preceded by a `LayerNormalization` layer.

#### **2. The Activation Function: Beyond ReLU**

While the original Transformer used ReLU, SOTA models use smoother and more expressive activations.

*   **GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit):**
    *   **What:** `activation="gelu"`. A smooth approximation of the rectifier (ReLU). It weights inputs by their magnitude, unlike ReLU which gates at zero.
    *   **Why:** It was shown to improve performance in models like BERT and GPT-2/3.

*   **SwiGLU (Swish-Gated Linear Unit): The Current SOTA**
    *   **What:** This is a more complex structure that provides a gating mechanism. The FFN is modified:
        1.  The input `x` is projected up to `(8/3) * d_model * 2` (or simply `2 * ffn_dim`, where `ffn_dim` is often `4 * d_model`).
        2.  This is split into two equal-sized tensors, `A` and `B`.
        3.  The output is calculated as: `(Swish(A)) * B`, where Swish is `x * sigmoid(x)`. In Keras, `gelu` is often used instead of Swish in `SwiGLU`'s activation component as in the LLaMA paper.
        4.  A final `Dense` layer projects this back down to `d_model`.
    *   **Why:** The gating mechanism (`* B`) allows the network to dynamically control how much information from the activated tensor `A` flows through. This has consistently shown superior performance in models like PaLM and LLaMA.

#### **3. FFN Regularization**

*   **Dropout:** The final `Dense` layer of the FFN is often followed by a `keras.layers.Dropout` layer. The dropout rate is typically the same as the attention dropout (`0.1`). This is a standard dropout on activations.
*   **Stochastic Depth:** This is applied to the *entire output* of the FFN sub-layer, as shown in the architectural diagram.

---

### Part 4: The Overarching Regularization and Optimization Regime

These techniques apply to the entire block and the model as a whole.

*   **Layer Normalization:**
    *   **Type:** Pre-LN.
    *   **Epsilon:** A small constant (`epsilon=1e-5` or `1e-6`) is added to the variance in the denominator for numerical stability.
    *   **Parameters:** `LayerNorm` has learnable `gamma` (scale) and `beta` (shift) parameters. These parameters are **typically excluded** from weight decay.

*   **Stochastic Depth (DropPath):**
    *   **What:** A `keras.layers.StochasticDepth` that wraps the output of each sub-layer (MHA and FFN).
    *   **How Much?** A typical rate is `0.1`. In very deep networks, this rate can be scheduled to increase linearly with the depth of the layer (e.g., from `0.0` at the first layer to `0.1` at the last).
    *   **Why:** It's a more powerful regularizer than conventional dropout, as it forces the model to rely on different network paths and depths, creating an implicit ensemble.

*   **The Optimizer: AdamW**
    *   **What:** `keras.optimizers.AdamW`.
    *   **Why it's Essential:** Standard `Adam` with L2 regularization is flawed; the effective weight decay is coupled with the adaptive learning rate, making it unpredictable. `AdamW` decouples the weight decay from the gradient update, applying it directly to the weights as described in the original L2 regularization formulation. This is the **de facto standard**.
    *   **Weight Decay Value:** A strong regularization value like `0.1` is common for training LLMs from scratch. For fine-tuning, this is often reduced significantly (e.g., `0.01` or `0.0`).
