# Complete Guide: Training Reasoning-Capable Text and Vision-Language Models Through Foundational Logic and Abstract Constraint Satisfaction

## Overview

This comprehensive guide presents a progressive methodology for training both Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform genuine abstract reasoning. Beginning with foundational logical operations and building up to complex constraint satisfaction problems, we develop models that learn generalizable problem-solving skills across both symbolic and visual domains.

---

## Part 0: Foundational Logic Operations Training

### Core Philosophy: Building Logical Primitives

Before tackling complex constraint satisfaction, models must master fundamental logical operations. These primitives form the building blocks of all higher-order reasoning.

### Operation 1: Boolean Logic (AND, OR, NOT)

#### Conceptual Foundation
**AND**: True only when all inputs are true
**OR**: True when at least one input is true  
**NOT**: Inverts the truth value

#### Training Methodology

**Text-Based Training Examples**:

```
BASIC AND OPERATION:
Problem: "Given conditions A and B, determine if both are satisfied."
Input: A = "The number is even", B = "The number is greater than 10"
Test case: Number = 12
Solution process:
1. Check condition A: 12 is even → TRUE
2. Check condition B: 12 > 10 → TRUE  
3. Apply AND: TRUE AND TRUE → TRUE
Result: Both conditions satisfied

BASIC OR OPERATION:
Problem: "Given conditions A or B, determine if at least one is satisfied."
Input: A = "Contains letter 'a'", B = "Has more than 5 characters"
Test case: Word = "hello"
Solution process:
1. Check condition A: "hello" contains 'a' → FALSE
2. Check condition B: "hello" has 5 characters, not more than 5 → FALSE
3. Apply OR: FALSE OR FALSE → FALSE
Result: Neither condition satisfied
```

**Visual-Based Training Examples**:

```
VISUAL AND OPERATION:
Input: [Image showing geometric shapes]
Conditions: A = "Shape is red", B = "Shape is circular"
Task: "Identify shapes that satisfy both conditions"

Solution process:
VISUAL ANALYSIS:
- Shape 1: Red triangle → A=TRUE, B=FALSE → AND=FALSE
- Shape 2: Blue circle → A=FALSE, B=TRUE → AND=FALSE  
- Shape 3: Red circle → A=TRUE, B=TRUE → AND=TRUE
Result: Only Shape 3 satisfies both conditions
```

#### Progressive Complexity Scaling

**Level 1**: Single condition evaluation
**Level 2**: Two conditions with basic AND/OR
**Level 3**: Three conditions with nested operations
**Level 4**: Complex nested boolean expressions

```
LEVEL 4 EXAMPLE:
Expression: (A AND B) OR (C AND NOT D)
Conditions:
A = "Number divisible by 2"
B = "Number less than 20" 
C = "Number divisible by 3"
D = "Number divisible by 5"
Test: Number = 15

Solution chain:
1. A: 15 ÷ 2 = 7.5 → FALSE
2. B: 15 < 20 → TRUE
3. C: 15 ÷ 3 = 5 → TRUE  
4. D: 15 ÷ 5 = 3 → TRUE
5. NOT D: NOT TRUE → FALSE
6. (A AND B): FALSE AND TRUE → FALSE
7. (C AND NOT D): TRUE AND FALSE → FALSE
8. Final: FALSE OR FALSE → FALSE
```

### Operation 2: Extended Boolean Logic (XOR, NAND)

#### Conceptual Foundation
**XOR**: True when inputs differ (exclusive or)
**NAND**: False only when all inputs are true (NOT AND)

#### Training Examples

```
XOR OPERATION:
Problem: "Determine if exactly one condition is true"
Conditions: A = "Number is prime", B = "Number is even"  
Test: Number = 7

Solution process:
1. Check A: 7 is prime → TRUE
2. Check B: 7 is even → FALSE
3. Apply XOR: TRUE XOR FALSE → TRUE
Result: Exactly one condition satisfied

NAND OPERATION:
Problem: "Check if NOT all conditions are simultaneously true"
Conditions: A = "Shape is square", B = "Shape is blue"
Visual input: [Blue square]

Solution process:
1. Check A: Shape is square → TRUE
2. Check B: Shape is blue → TRUE  
3. Apply NAND: NOT(TRUE AND TRUE) → NOT(TRUE) → FALSE
Result: All conditions are true, so NAND is false
```

### Operation 3: Counting Operations

#### Conceptual Foundation
Quantitative reasoning about collections and frequencies.

#### Training Framework

**Basic Counting**:
```
SIMPLE COUNT:
Task: "Count objects matching condition"
Input: [Visual array of shapes: 3 red circles, 2 blue squares, 1 green triangle]
Condition: "Red objects"
Solution process:
1. Identify red objects: Circle 1, Circle 2, Circle 3
2. Count: 1, 2, 3
Result: 3 red objects
```

**Conditional Counting**:
```
COMPLEX COUNT:
Task: "Count objects satisfying multiple conditions"
Input: [Grid of colored shapes with sizes]
Condition: "Large shapes that are either red OR circular"
Solution process:
1. Identify large shapes: [List all large shapes]
2. For each large shape, check: (red OR circular)
   - Large red square: red=TRUE, circular=FALSE → TRUE OR FALSE → TRUE ✓
   - Large blue circle: red=FALSE, circular=TRUE → FALSE OR TRUE → TRUE ✓  
   - Large green triangle: red=FALSE, circular=FALSE → FALSE OR FALSE → FALSE ✗
3. Count qualifying shapes: 2
Result: 2 objects satisfy the complex condition
```

**Comparative Counting**:
```
COMPARISON COUNT:
Task: "Compare quantities across categories"
Input: [Mixed collection of objects]
Question: "Are there more red objects than blue objects?"
Solution process:
1. Count red objects: [systematic enumeration] → 5
2. Count blue objects: [systematic enumeration] → 3
3. Compare: 5 > 3 → TRUE
Result: Yes, more red than blue objects
```

### Operation 4: Set Operations and Uniqueness (UNIQUE)

#### Conceptual Foundation
Understanding collections, membership, and uniqueness constraints.

#### Training Examples

**Basic Set Operations**:
```
SET MEMBERSHIP:
Task: "Determine if element belongs to set"
Set A = {red, blue, green}
Query: "Is 'purple' in Set A?"
Solution process:
1. Check each element in A: red ≠ purple, blue ≠ purple, green ≠ purple
2. No matches found
Result: FALSE, 'purple' is not in Set A

SET INTERSECTION:
Task: "Find common elements between sets"
Set A = {circle, square, triangle}
Set B = {square, pentagon, circle}
Solution process:
1. Check each element of A against B:
   - circle: in B ✓
   - square: in B ✓  
   - triangle: not in B ✗
2. Common elements: {circle, square}
Result: Intersection = {circle, square}
```

**Uniqueness Constraints**:
```
UNIQUENESS CHECK:
Task: "Verify all elements in collection are unique"
Collection: [A, B, C, A, D]
Solution process:
1. Track seen elements: {}
2. Process each element:
   - A: not in seen, add to seen → {A}
   - B: not in seen, add to seen → {A, B}
   - C: not in seen, add to seen → {A, B, C}
   - A: already in seen → VIOLATION
   - Stop: uniqueness violated
Result: FALSE, collection contains duplicates

UNIQUE SET BUILDING:
Task: "Build set of unique elements from collection"
Input: [red circle, blue square, red circle, green triangle, blue square]
Solution process:
1. Initialize unique set: {}
2. Process each element:
   - red circle: not in set, add → {red circle}
   - blue square: not in set, add → {red circle, blue square}  
   - red circle: already in set, skip
   - green triangle: not in set, add → {red circle, blue square, green triangle}
   - blue square: already in set, skip
Result: Unique set = {red circle, blue square, green triangle}
```

### Visual-Spatial Logic Operations

#### Visual Boolean Logic

```
VISUAL AND OPERATION:
Input: [Image with multiple objects]
Task: "Find objects that are both large AND red"
Visual reasoning process:
1. Identify all objects in image
2. For each object, evaluate:
   - Size condition (large): measure relative to reference
   - Color condition (red): analyze color channels
3. Apply AND logic to each object
4. Highlight objects satisfying both conditions
```

#### Visual Counting with Spatial Constraints

```
SPATIAL COUNTING:
Input: [2D grid with various shapes]
Task: "Count blue circles in the top half of the grid"
Visual-spatial reasoning:
1. Define grid boundaries and top half region
2. Identify all objects in top half
3. Filter for blue objects: [list blue objects in top half]
4. Filter for circular objects: [list circular objects from blue objects]  
5. Count final set
Result: N blue circles in top half
```

#### Visual Set Operations

```
VISUAL SET INTERSECTION:
Input: [Two overlapping regions with objects]
Task: "Find objects present in both regions"
Visual reasoning:
1. Define Region A boundaries
2. Define Region B boundaries  
3. Identify objects in Region A
4. Identify objects in Region B
5. Find spatial intersection of regions
6. List objects within intersection area
Result: Objects present in both regions
```

## Part I: Advanced Reasoning Types Building on Foundations

### Text-Based Reasoning (LLMs)

#### 1. Constraint Satisfaction Reasoning
**Building on Foundations**: Combines boolean logic, counting, and set operations

**Enhanced Understanding**:
- **Rule Comprehension**: Uses AND/OR logic to understand compound constraints
- **State Management**: Employs set operations to track valid/invalid placements
- **Constraint Propagation**: Applies logical deduction chains using foundational operations

**Example Integration**:
```
SUDOKU CONSTRAINT CHECK:
Cell (2,3) candidate evaluation for number 7:

BOOLEAN CONSTRAINT CHECK:
1. Row constraint: 7 NOT in row 2 → check set membership → TRUE
2. Column constraint: 7 NOT in column 3 → check set membership → TRUE  
3. Box constraint: 7 NOT in box(2,3) → check set membership → TRUE
4. Final: (row constraint) AND (column constraint) AND (box constraint)
           TRUE AND TRUE AND TRUE → TRUE
Result: 7 is valid candidate for cell (2,3)

COUNTING VERIFICATION:
- Count occurrences of 7 in row 2: COUNT(7 in row2) = 0 ✓
- Count occurrences of 7 in col 3: COUNT(7 in col3) = 0 ✓  
- Count occurrences of 7 in box: COUNT(7 in box) = 0 ✓
All counts = 0, confirming uniqueness constraint satisfied
```

#### 2. Symbolic and Logical Reasoning
**Building on Foundations**: Extends boolean logic to symbol manipulation

**Enhanced Capabilities**:
- **Complex Deduction**: Multi-step logical chains using AND/OR/NOT combinations
- **Symbol Set Operations**: Applying UNIQUE and set membership to symbol placement
- **Conditional Logic**: Using XOR for mutually exclusive conditions

#### 3. Algorithmic and Procedural Reasoning
**Building on Foundations**: Systematizes counting and logic operations

**Algorithm Integration**:
```
NAKED SINGLE ALGORITHM:
For each empty cell:
1. Initialize candidate set: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
2. Row elimination: candidate_set = candidate_set - set(row_numbers)
3. Column elimination: candidate_set = candidate_set - set(column_numbers)  
4. Box elimination: candidate_set = candidate_set - set(box_numbers)
5. Count candidates: COUNT(candidate_set)
6. IF COUNT = 1 THEN cell value = unique_element(candidate_set)
7. ELSE continue to next cell

This algorithm combines:
- Set operations (-, membership)
- Counting (COUNT function)
- Boolean logic (IF/THEN conditional)
- Uniqueness checking (UNIQUE element extraction)
```

### Visual-Spatial Reasoning (VLMs)

#### 5. Visual-Spatial Constraint Reasoning
**Building on Foundations**: Applies logical operations to spatial relationships

**Spatial Boolean Logic**:
```
ADJACENCY CONSTRAINT CHECK:
For patch placement at position (x,y):

SPATIAL CONDITIONS:
A = "Left edge matches adjacent patch"
B = "Top edge matches adjacent patch"  
C = "Right edge matches adjacent patch"
D = "Bottom edge matches adjacent patch"

BOUNDARY LOGIC:
IF position is corner: require 2 edge matches
IF position is edge: require 3 edge matches  
IF position is interior: require 4 edge matches

EXAMPLE - Corner position (0,0):
Required: A AND B (left and top edges must match)
Evaluation: A=TRUE, B=TRUE → TRUE AND TRUE → TRUE ✓
```

**Visual Counting with Constraints**:
```
PATTERN COUNTING:
Task: "Count visual elements satisfying spatial and color constraints"

MULTI-CONDITION COUNT:
For each element in visual field:
1. Position constraint: element in specified region → boolean
2. Color constraint: element matches color criteria → boolean  
3. Shape constraint: element matches shape criteria → boolean
4. Combined: position AND color AND shape → boolean
5. IF combined = TRUE: increment count

Final count represents elements satisfying all constraints
```

## Part II: Text-Based Training Methodology (Enhanced)

### Step 1: Foundational Logic Integration

**Enhanced Parameterization** building on logical primitives:

**Logical Constraint Variations**:
- **Boolean Compound Rules**: (row unique) AND (column unique) AND (box unique)
- **Conditional Rules**: IF cell in region A, THEN additional constraint X applies
- **Counting Rules**: Each symbol must appear EXACTLY N times in specified regions
- **Set Rules**: Symbol placement must maintain uniqueness across defined sets

**Example Enhanced Training**:
```
LOGICAL SUDOKU VARIANT:
Grid: 4×4, Symbols: {A, B, C, D}

COMPOUND CONSTRAINTS:
1. Standard uniqueness: (unique in row) AND (unique in column) AND (unique in 2×2 box)
2. Counting constraint: COUNT(each symbol in grid) = 4
3. Conditional constraint: IF symbol in corner position, THEN cannot be adjacent to same symbol
4. Set constraint: {corner symbols} must form unique set

SOLUTION PROCESS WITH LOGIC FOUNDATIONS:
1. BOOLEAN EVALUATION: For cell (1,1) candidate 'A':
   - Row check: 'A' NOT in row 1 → TRUE
   - Column check: 'A' NOT in column 1 → TRUE
   - Box check: 'A' NOT in box(1,1) → TRUE  
   - Standard: TRUE AND TRUE AND TRUE → TRUE ✓
   
2. COUNTING CHECK:
   - Current count of 'A' in grid: COUNT('A') = 2
   - Maximum allowed: 4
   - Can place: 2 < 4 → TRUE ✓
   
3. CONDITIONAL CHECK:
   - Position (1,1) is corner: TRUE
   - Check adjacency rule for corners
   - Adjacent positions to (1,1): (1,2), (2,1)
   - 'A' not in adjacent positions → TRUE ✓
   
4. SET CONSTRAINT CHECK:
   - Current corner symbols: {B, ?, C, ?}
   - Adding 'A' to position (1,1): {A, ?, C, ?}  
   - Check uniqueness: A ≠ C → TRUE ✓

5. FINAL LOGIC: standard AND counting AND conditional AND set
   TRUE AND TRUE AND TRUE AND TRUE → TRUE
   
Result: 'A' is valid for position (1,1)
```

### Step 2: Multi-Format Training with Logic Emphasis

**Enhanced Format Examples**:

**Logic-Explicit Format**:

    "COUNT(symbol_S in grid) <= max_count FOR ALL symbols S"  
  ],
  conditional_rules: [
    "IF position in edge_positions THEN adjacency_rule applies"
  ]
}

GRID_STATE {
  size: [4, 4],
  symbols: [A, B, C, D],
  current_state: [[A, null, null, B], ...]
}

SOLVE_REQUEST: "Apply constraint set to find valid completion"

   - Final: TRUE OR FALSE → TRUE ✓
   
   Object 2: A=FALSE, B=FALSE, C=TRUE, D=TRUE  
   - (A AND B): FALSE AND FALSE → FALSE
   - (C AND NOT D): TRUE AND NOT TRUE → TRUE AND FALSE → FALSE
   - Final: FALSE OR FALSE → FALSE ✗

6. RESULT: Objects satisfying compound condition
```

#### Visual Counting with Logical Constraints

Task: "Count objects in overlapping regions with logical conditions"

INPUT: [Image with defined regions R1, R2, R3]
CONDITION: "Count red objects that are in (R1 OR R2) AND NOT in R3"

ALGORITHM:
1. REGION MEMBERSHIP: For each object, determine region membership
   - Object O1: in_R1=TRUE, in_R2=FALSE, in_R3=TRUE
   - Object O2: in_R1=FALSE, in_R2=TRUE, in_R3=FALSE
   - Object O3: in_R1=TRUE, in_R2=TRUE, in_R3=FALSE

2. COLOR CLASSIFICATION: Determine color of each object
   - O1: red=TRUE, O2: red=TRUE, O3: red=FALSE

3. LOGICAL EVALUATION per object:
   - O1: red=TRUE, (in_R1 OR in_R2)=TRUE OR FALSE=TRUE, NOT in_R3=NOT TRUE=FALSE
         Final: TRUE AND TRUE AND FALSE = FALSE ✗
   - O2: red=TRUE, (in_R1 OR in_R2)=FALSE OR TRUE=TRUE, NOT in_R3=NOT FALSE=TRUE  
         Final: TRUE AND TRUE AND TRUE = TRUE ✓
   - O3: red=FALSE, stops evaluation (red condition fails) ✗

4. COUNT: Sum of objects satisfying all conditions = 1
```

1. Standard uniqueness (boolean logic per region)
2. Visual harmony: Adjacent symbols must have complementary colors  
3. Shape distribution: COUNT(each shape type) = 4
4. Spatial balance: Each quadrant must have visual "weight" balance

MULTI-MODAL REASONING:
SYMBOLIC LAYER:
- Apply standard Sudoku boolean logic for uniqueness
