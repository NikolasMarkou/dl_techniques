## 3. Analysis Capabilities

The analyzer computes a wide range of metrics across four key areas of model behavior.

### Weight Analysis Metrics

| Metric                | Description                                         | Interpretation                                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1/L2/Spectral Norms** | Measures of weight magnitude and complexity.        | Higher values indicate larger weights; controls stability. |
| **Weight Distribution** | Statistical properties (mean, std, skew, kurtosis). | Indicates weight health and potential for vanishing/exploding gradients. |
| **Sparsity**          | Fraction of near-zero weights in a layer.           | High sparsity can indicate under-utilized or dead neurons. |
| **Health Score**      | A combined metric (0-1) summarizing weight health.  | Higher score = healthier weight distribution.             |

### Calibration & Confidence Metrics

| Metric             | Description                                          | Ideal Value     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **ECE**            | Expected Calibration Error. Measures gap between confidence and accuracy. | 0 (perfect calibration) |
| **Brier Score**    | Mean squared error for probabilistic predictions.    | 0 (perfect predictions) |
| **Mean Confidence**| Average of the max probability for each prediction.  | Context-dependent |
| **Mean Entropy**   | Average uncertainty across all predictions.          | Context-dependent |

### Information Flow Metrics

| Metric                  | Description                                            | Interpretation                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Activation Statistics** | Mean, std, and sparsity of layer activations.          | Indicates layer health, utilization, and potential for dead neurons.        |
| **Effective Rank**      | Dimensionality of the information represented by a layer. | Higher rank suggests more diverse and expressive feature representations.  |
| **Positive Ratio**      | Fraction of positive activations (e.g., after ReLU).   | Indicates activation patterns; values near 0 or 1 suggest saturation.       |
| **Specialization Score**| A combined metric measuring a layer's feature learning quality. | Higher score suggests a good balance of activation, diversity, and utilization. |

### Training Dynamics Metrics

| Metric                  | Description                                                     | Interpretation                                            |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Epochs to Convergence** | Epochs to reach 95% of peak validation performance.             | Lower is faster and more efficient learning.              |
| **Overfitting Index**   | Average (Val Loss - Train Loss) in the final third of training. | Positive values indicate overfitting.                     |
| **Training Stability**  | Standard deviation of recent validation losses.                 | Lower values indicate more stable training convergence.   |
| **Peak Performance**    | Best validation accuracy/loss achieved and at which epoch.      | The model's best potential performance during training.   |
| **Final Gap**           | Difference between validation and training loss at the last epoch. | Indicates the final overfitting or underfitting state.    |

## 4. Usage Patterns & Use Cases

### Pattern 1: Single Model Deep Dive

Use the analyzer to thoroughly debug a single model's performance and behavior.

```python
# Scenario: A model's performance is unexpectedly low.
model = keras.models.load_model('path/to/problem_model.keras')
# history = training_history_for_the_model

config = AnalysisConfig(
    analyze_weights=True,
    analyze_information_flow=True,  # Check for dead neurons/layers
    analyze_calibration=True,
    analyze_training_dynamics=True
)

analyzer = ModelAnalyzer(
    models={'ProblemModel': model},
    training_history={'ProblemModel': history},
    config=config
)
results = analyzer.analyze(test_data)

# Next steps:
# 1. Check `weight_learning_journey.png` for exploding/vanishing weights.
# 2. Check `information_flow_analysis.png` for dead layers (low activation/rank).
# 3. Check `training_dynamics.png` for severe overfitting or unstable training.
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Model Comparison for Selection

Compare different architectures or training runs to select the best candidate.

```python
# Scenario: Choose the best model from multiple architectures for production.
models = {
    'ResNet50': resnet_model,
    'EfficientNet': efficientnet_model,
    'ConvNext': convnext_model
}

analyzer = ModelAnalyzer(models=models)
results = analyzer.analyze(test_data)

# Next steps:
# 1. Start with `summary_dashboard.png`. The performance table gives a quick overview.
# 2. Check the "Calibration Landscape" plot. Models in the bottom-left (low ECE, low Brier) are best.
# 3. Use the "Model Similarity" plot to see which models learned similar representations.
```

### Pattern 3: Hyperparameter Sweep Analysis

Efficiently analyze the results of a hyperparameter sweep to find the optimal configuration.

```python
# Scenario: Find the best learning rate and batch size from a sweep.
models = {
    'lr_0.001_batch_32': model_1,
    'lr_0.01_batch_32': model_2,
    'lr_0.001_batch_64': model_3,
    'lr_0.01_batch_64': model_4
}
histories = {name: h for name, h in sweep_histories.items()}

config = AnalysisConfig(
    analyze_training_dynamics=True,
    pareto_analysis_threshold=2 # Generate Pareto plot if 2+ models are provided
)

analyzer = ModelAnalyzer(models=models, training_history=histories, config=config)
results = analyzer.analyze(validation_data)

# Generate and save the Pareto analysis plot
pareto_fig = analyzer.create_pareto_analysis()

# Next steps:
# 1. Open `pareto_analysis.png`. The scatter plot shows models on the Pareto front (optimal trade-offs between accuracy and overfitting).
# 2. Use the heatmap to compare normalized performance across all models and metrics.
```

## 5. Advanced Configuration

The `AnalysisConfig` class provides fine-grained control over the analysis process.

```python
config = AnalysisConfig(
    # === Main Toggles ===
    analyze_weights=True,
    analyze_calibration=True,
    analyze_information_flow=True,
    analyze_training_dynamics=True,

    # === Data Sampling ===
    n_samples=1000,  # Max samples to use for data-dependent analyses (e.g., calibration)

    # === Weight Analysis ===
    weight_layer_types=['Dense', 'Conv2D'],  # Only analyze weights from these layer types
    analyze_biases=False,                  # Exclude bias vectors from analysis
    compute_weight_pca=True,               # Enable model similarity analysis

    # === Calibration Analysis ===
    calibration_bins=15,                   # Number of bins for ECE calculation

    # === Training Dynamics ===
    smooth_training_curves=True,           # Apply a moving average filter to training curves
    smoothing_window=5,                    # The window size for the smoothing filter

    # === Visualization & Output ===
    plot_style='publication',              # 'publication', 'presentation', or 'draft'
    save_plots=True,
    save_format='png',                     # 'png', 'pdf', 'svg'
    dpi=300,

    # === Performance & Limits ===
    max_layers_heatmap=12,                 # Max layers in the weight health heatmap
    max_layers_info_flow=8,                # Max layers in information flow plots
    verbose=True,                          # Enable detailed logging
)
```

## 6. Understanding the Output

After running, the analyzer saves plots and a JSON data file to the output directory.

### Key Visualizations Explained

#### 1. Summary Dashboard (`summary_dashboard.png`)

A 2x2 grid providing a holistic view of all models.

-   **Performance Table**: Key metrics for each model, including training insights if history is provided.
-   **Model Similarity**: A 2D PCA plot of weight statistics. Models that are close together have learned similar weight distributions.
-   **Confidence Profiles**: Violin plots showing the distribution of prediction confidence (max probability) for each model.
-   **Calibration Landscape**: A scatter plot of ECE vs. Brier Score. Models in the bottom-left quadrant are well-calibrated and have high probabilistic accuracy.

#### 2. Training Dynamics (`training_dynamics.png`)

A deep dive into the learning process.

-   **Loss/Accuracy Curves**: Smoothed training and validation curves.
-   **Overfitting Analysis**: Plots the gap (validation loss - training loss) over epochs. A positive gap indicates overfitting.
-   **Best Epoch Performance**: A scatter plot showing each model's peak validation accuracy versus the epoch it was achieved. Helps identify models that learn faster.
-   **Summary Table**: Quantitative training metrics like convergence speed and stability.

#### 3. Weight Learning Journey (`weight_learning_journey.png`)

Assesses the health and evolution of model weights.

-   **Weight Evolution**: Shows how the L2 norm of weights changes across the layers of the network. Look for smooth progressions, not sudden explosions or collapses.
-   **Health Heatmap**: A layer-by-layer health score for each model. Green indicates healthy weights; red indicates potential issues like high sparsity or unstable distributions.

#### 4. Confidence & Calibration Analysis (`confidence_calibration_analysis.png`)

Evaluates the reliability of model predictions.

-   **Reliability Diagram**: Compares predicted probability to the actual fraction of positives. A perfectly calibrated model follows the diagonal.
-   **Confidence Distributions**: Violin plots showing how confident each model is.
-   **Per-Class ECE**: Bar chart showing calibration error for each class, helping to identify problematic classes.
-   **Uncertainty Landscape**: A 2D density plot of prediction confidence vs. entropy. Shows the model's uncertainty profile.

#### 5. Information Flow Analysis (`information_flow_analysis.png`)

Diagnoses how information propagates through the network.

-   **Activation Flow Overview**: Tracks the mean and standard deviation of activations through the layers. Helps spot vanishing or exploding activations.
-   **Effective Rank Evolution**: Plots the dimensionality of information at each layer. A collapsing rank may indicate a bottleneck.
-   **Activation Health Dashboard**: A heatmap showing potential issues like dead neurons (high sparsity) or saturated activations.
-   **Layer Specialization Analysis**: Plots a "specialization score" for each layer, indicating how well it's learning diverse features.

#### 6. Pareto Analysis (`pareto_analysis.png`)

(Generated with `create_pareto_analysis()`) A powerful tool for hyperparameter tuning.

-   **Pareto Front Plot**: A scatter plot of Peak Accuracy vs. Overfitting Index. Models on the red-dashed "Pareto Front" represent the best possible trade-offs.
-   **Normalized Performance Heatmap**: A heatmap comparing all models across normalized metrics (accuracy, low overfitting, fast convergence), making it easy to see which configuration excels in which area.

## 7. Troubleshooting

-   **Multi-Input Models**: The analyzer has limited support for models with multiple inputs. It will log warnings and automatically skip incompatible analyses (like calibration and information flow) for these models to prevent errors.
-   **"No training metrics found"**: The analyzer robustly searches for common metric names (`accuracy`, `val_loss`, etc.). If you use non-standard names in your `history` object, analysis will be limited. Ensure your Keras history keys are standard.
-   **Memory Issues**: For very large models or datasets, analysis can be memory-intensive. Reduce the sample size and disable the most expensive analyses in `AnalysisConfig`:
    ```python
    config = AnalysisConfig(
        n_samples=500,                  # Reduce from default 1000
        analyze_information_flow=False, # This is often the most memory-intensive
        max_layers_heatmap=8            # Limit heatmap size
    )
    ```
-   **Plots look wrong/empty**: Enable verbose logging (`config = AnalysisConfig(verbose=True)`) and check the console output. You can also inspect the `analysis_results.json` file to see what data was successfully computed.

## 8. Extensions

The toolkit is designed to be extensible. You can add your own custom analysis and visualization modules by inheriting from the base classes.

### Creating a Custom Analyzer

Extend the `BaseAnalyzer` class and implement the `analyze` method.

```python
from analyzer.analyzers.base import BaseAnalyzer
from analyzer.data_types import AnalysisResults, DataInput

class MyCustomAnalyzer(BaseAnalyzer):
    def requires_data(self) -> bool:
        return True # This analyzer needs data

    def analyze(self, results: AnalysisResults, data: DataInput, cache: dict) -> None:
        # Your custom logic here
        custom_metrics = {}
        for model_name, model in self.models.items():
            # ... compute your metrics ...
            custom_metrics[model_name] = {'my_score': 0.99}

        # Store results in the main results object
        results.custom_metrics = custom_metrics
```

### Creating a Custom Visualizer

Extend the `BaseVisualizer` class and implement the plotting logic.

```python
from analyzer.visualizers.base import BaseVisualizer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class MyCustomVisualizer(BaseVisualizer):
    def create_visualizations(self) -> None:
        if not hasattr(self.results, 'custom_metrics'):
            return

        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        # ... your custom plotting logic ...
        # You can access self.results, self.config, and self.model_colors

        if self.config.save_plots:
            self._save_figure(fig, 'my_custom_plot')
        plt.close(fig)
```
