Adaptive Temperature Softmax Implementation
========================================

Overview:
---------
This implementation provides an enhanced version of the softmax function that dynamically
adjusts its temperature parameter based on the entropy of the input distribution. The
goal is to maintain sharpness in the output probabilities even as the input size grows,
addressing a fundamental limitation of standard softmax.

Standard Softmax Limitations:
---------------------------
1. Dispersion Effect:
   - As input size (n) grows, probabilities tend towards 1/n
   - Theoretical proof shows this is inevitable for any non-zero temperature
   - Makes it difficult to maintain sharp focus on specific inputs

2. Out-of-Distribution Behavior:
   - Performance degrades significantly on larger input sizes than seen during training
   - Standard softmax cannot adapt to varying input complexities
   - No mechanism to adjust sharpness based on input characteristics

3. Fixed Temperature:
   - Standard temperature parameter must be chosen at training time
   - No way to adapt to different input distributions
   - Trade-off between sharpness and stability cannot be dynamically balanced

Implementation Details:
---------------------
1. Entropy Computation:
   - First applies standard softmax to get initial probability distribution
   - Computes Shannon entropy: H = -Σ p_i * log(p_i)
   - Uses epsilon padding to avoid numerical instability with log(0)
   - Entropy provides measure of how dispersed current distribution is

2. Temperature Adaptation:
   - Uses polynomial fit based on empirical data
   - Coefficients: [-0.037, 0.481, -2.3, 4.917, -1.791]
   - Maps entropy to temperature value
   - Constrains temperature to [min_temp, max_temp] range
   - Never increases temperature above 1.0 to avoid additional dispersion

3. Selective Application:
   - Only adapts temperature when entropy exceeds threshold (default 0.5)
   - Maintains original behavior for already-sharp distributions
   - Smooth transition between adapted and non-adapted regions
   - Computationally efficient by avoiding unnecessary adaptations

4. Final Computation:
   - Scales logits by inverse temperature: logits * (1/T)
   - Applies final softmax to get output probabilities
   - Maintains proper probability distribution (sums to 1.0)

Improvements Over Standard Softmax:
--------------------------------
1. Performance Benefits:
   - Maintains sharpness with increasing input size
   - Better generalization to out-of-distribution inputs
   - Example improvements on max retrieval task:
     * 512 items: 70.1% → 72.5% (+2.4%)
     * 1024 items: 53.8% → 57.7% (+3.9%)
     * 2048 items: 35.7% → 39.4% (+3.7%)

2. Adaptive Behavior:
   - Dynamically adjusts to input complexity
   - No need to tune temperature parameter manually
   - Automatically handles varying input sizes
   - Preserves sharp attention when appropriate

3. Stability Features:
   - Numerically stable with epsilon handling
   - Smooth temperature transitions
   - Bounded output ranges
   - Maintains probability distribution properties

4. Implementation Advantages:
   - Drop-in replacement for standard softmax
   - No additional training required
   - Minimal computational overhead
   - Thread-safe implementation
   - Type-safe with proper error handling

Usage Guidelines:
---------------
1. When to Use:
   - Large-scale attention mechanisms
   - Variable input size scenarios
   - Out-of-distribution robustness needed
   - When sharp focus must be maintained

2. Parameter Tuning:
   - min_temp: Lower bound for temperature (default 0.1)
     * Too low: May cause numerical instability
     * Too high: Limits maximum sharpness

   - max_temp: Upper bound for temperature (default 1.0)
     * Too low: Limits flexibility
     * Too high: Can cause excessive dispersion

   - entropy_threshold: When to apply adaptation (default 0.5)
     * Too low: May adapt unnecessarily
     * Too high: May miss adaptation opportunities

3. Integration Tips:
   - Use layer version for stateful models
   - Use functional version for simple cases
   - Monitor entropy values for tuning
   - Consider batch statistics for threshold selection

Performance Considerations:
------------------------
1. Computational Cost:
   - Two softmax operations vs one in standard version
   - Additional entropy computation
   - Polynomial evaluation for temperature
   - Overall minimal overhead compared to attention computation

2. Memory Usage:
   - Additional temporary tensors for entropy and temperature
   - No persistent memory overhead
   - Batch-friendly implementation
   - Efficient use of broadcasting

3. Numerical Precision:
   - Uses float32 precision
   - Epsilon padding for stability
   - Bounded temperature ranges
   - Safe polynomial evaluation

4. Optimization Opportunities:
   - Batch-wise temperature computation
   - Cached polynomial coefficients
   - Fused operations where possible
   - Early exit for low-entropy cases

Extension Points:
---------------
1. Alternative Temperature Functions:
   - Could replace polynomial fit with neural network
   - Experiment with different entropy mappings
   - Add input-dependent adaptation
   - Consider learnable coefficients

2. Additional Metrics:
   - Monitor dispersion statistics
   - Track adaptation frequency
   - Measure sharpness metrics
   - Profile temperature distribution

3. Advanced Features:
   - Multi-head specific temperatures
   - Layer-wise adaptation strategies
   - Input modality specific tuning
   - Gradient-based temperature optimization

4. Integration Options:
   - Custom training loops
   - Distributed training support
   - Mixed precision compatibility
   - Framework-specific optimizations

Error Handling:
-------------
1. Input Validation:
   - Positive temperature range checks
   - Valid threshold values
   - Proper tensor shapes
   - Dtype compatibility

2. Runtime Checks:
   - Numerical stability monitoring
   - NaN detection
   - Probability sum verification
   - Temperature bounds enforcement

3. Error Recovery:
   - Fallback to standard softmax
   - Warning generation
   - Logging support
   - Graceful degradation

4. Debug Support:
   - Entropy monitoring
   - Temperature tracking
   - Distribution statistics
   - Performance profiling
