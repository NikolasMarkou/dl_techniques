"""
Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE), a scale-free loss metric.

This loss function evaluates forecast accuracy by comparing the model's
performance against a simple, naive baseline forecast (e.g., predicting
the previous value). This relative comparison makes the metric scale-
independent, allowing for meaningful performance evaluation across different
time series, regardless of their native units or magnitudes.

Architecturally, MASE provides a more informative training objective than
standard error metrics like MAE or MSE for many forecasting tasks. A MASE
value is directly interpretable: a value less than 1.0 indicates that the
model is outperforming the naive benchmark, while a value greater than 1.0
indicates it is performing worse. This provides a clear, standardized
measure of forecasting skill. This specific implementation calculates the
naive forecast error on a per-batch basis, making it a self-contained and
practical loss function for mini-batch training, although this is an
approximation of the canonical MASE which uses a global scaling factor
derived from the entire training set.

Foundational Mathematics
------------------------
MASE is defined as the ratio of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the
forecast to the MAE of a naive, in-sample benchmark forecast.

    MASE = MAE_forecast / MAE_naive

1.  **Forecast Error (Numerator)**: This is the standard MAE of the
    model's predictions over the forecast horizon.
    `MAE_forecast = mean(|y_true - y_pred|)`

2.  **Naive Scaling Factor (Denominator)**: This is the MAE of a simple,
    non-seasonal (`m=1`) or seasonal (`m > 1`) naive forecast, where the
    forecast for time `t` is the value from time `t-m`. For a time
    series `y` of length `T`, it is calculated over the training data as:
    `MAE_naive = (1 / (T - m)) * Î£ |y_t - y_{t-m}|` for `t` from `m+1`
    to `T`.

This denominator acts as a robust scaling factor, normalizing the forecast
error by a measure of the inherent variability and one-step
predictability of the time series itself.
