A production-ready, Keras 3 implementation of **MothNet**, a computational model of the insect olfactory network designed to excel at machine learning tasks with **limited training data**. Its primary function is to serve as a powerful, automatic feature generator that can be prepended to any standard ML classifier, creating a hybrid "insect cyborg" model with significantly enhanced performance.

This implementation provides a modular, fully serializable `keras.Model` that faithfully reproduces the three key stages of insect olfaction: the Antennal Lobe, the Mushroom Body, and a Hebbian Readout. The model is trained using a biologically plausible, local Hebbian learning rule instead of backpropagation, making it a unique tool for data-scarce environments.

## 1. Overview: What is MothNet and the "Insect Cyborg"

### What is MothNet?

**MothNet** is a bio-mimetic neural network that models the moth's olfactory (sense of smell) system. Moths are masters of **few-shot learning**—they can learn to identify a new flower's scent from just a few encounters. MothNet replicates the neural architecture that enables this remarkable data efficiency.

Instead of being a drop-in replacement for deep learning models, MothNet is best used as a **specialized feature generator**.

### The "Insect Cyborg" Concept

This is the primary and most powerful way to use MothNet. The process involves two stages:

1.  **Bio-Mimetic Feature Extraction**: A trained MothNet processes your raw data and generates a small set of highly informative, "bio-inspired" features.
2.  **Augmentation and Conventional ML**: These new features are **concatenated** with your original data. This augmented dataset is then fed into a standard, powerful classifier like an **SVM, Gradient Boosting, or a simple MLP**.

The resulting hybrid model—part biological network, part statistical algorithm—is the "insect cyborg." Research shows this approach can **reduce classification error by 20-60%** and achieve the same accuracy with **3x less data** compared to using the classifier alone.

### Why It Matters

**The Small Data Problem**:
```
Problem: Train an accurate classifier when you only have 1-100 samples per class.
Standard ML Approach:
  1. Use models like SVMs, Random Forests, or simple Neural Nets.
  2. Limitation: These models often struggle to find good decision boundaries
     with so little data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization.
  3. Result: High error rates and a need for more data that may not exist.
```

**MothNet's "Cyborg" Solution**:
```
MothNet's Approach:
  1. First, process the data through MothNet to extract features that are
     robust, sparse, and highly separable.
  2. Concatenate these bio-mimetic features with the original data.
  3. Train a standard SVM on this richer, augmented feature set.
  4. Benefit: The SVM now has access to both the original linear/kernel-based
     patterns AND the complex, combinatorial patterns discovered by MothNet.
     This makes its job vastly easier, leading to better performance with the same
     limited data.
```

## 2. The Problem MothNet Solves

### The Data Scarcity Barrier in Machine Learning

Many real-world problems do not have the luxury of "big data." In fields like medical diagnostics, industrial fault detection, or rare species identification, collecting labeled data is expensive, time-consuming, or impossible.

│      meaningful representations. They fail catastrophically │
│      on small datasets.                                     │
│                                                             │
│  Classical ML Models (SVM, k-NN):                           │
│    - Work better on small data but are limited by their     │
│      predefined feature spaces (e.g., linear or RBF kernels)│
│    - They cannot automatically engineer the complex,        │
│      non-linear features needed for difficult problems.     │

```

MothNet bridges this gap. It acts as an **automatic feature engineering front-end**, inspired by a biological system that evolved specifically to solve the few-shot learning problem.

## 3. How MothNet Works: Core Concepts

MothNet is a feed-forward cascade of three layers, each modeling a part of the insect brain.

## 4. Architecture Deep Dive

### 4.1 `AntennalLobeLayer` (AL)

-   **Purpose**: To clean up the input signal.
-   **Mechanism**: Implements **competitive inhibition**. Each neuron excites itself but inhibits all others globally. This "winner-take-more" dynamic enhances the contrast between strong and weak features, making the representation more robust.

### 4.2 `MushroomBodyLayer` (MB)

-   **Purpose**: The core of MothNet's feature engineering. It creates highly separable representations.
-   **Mechanism**:
    1.  **Dimensional Expansion**: Projects the input into a much higher-dimensional space (e.g., 85 features -> 4000 features) using a fixed, sparse random matrix. This is analogous to the kernel trick in SVMs, making non-linear patterns linearly separable.
    2.  **Sparsification**: It performs a **top-k winner-take-all**, keeping only a small fraction (e.g., 10%) of the most active neurons and silencing the rest. This creates a unique combinatorial code for each input.

### 4.3 `HebbianReadoutLayer`

-   **Purpose**: To learn associations between the sparse MB codes and the class labels.
-   **Mechanism**: Uses **Hebbian learning**, a local, biologically plausible rule. Instead of backpropagating a global error signal, it strengthens connections simply based on correlation: if an MB neuron fires at the same time as a target class is present, the weight between them increases. This layer is **not trained with gradient descent**.

## 5. Quick Start Guide: The "Cyborg" Paradigm

This is the recommended way to use MothNet for maximum performance.

### Installation

```bash
# Install Keras 3, a backend, and scikit-learn
pip install keras tensorflow numpy scikit-learn
```

### Your First "Insect Cyborg" Model (30 seconds)

Let's boost an SVM on a dummy classification task.

```python
import keras
import numpy as np
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Local imports from your project structure
from dl_techniques.models.mothnet.model import MothNet, create_cyborg_features

# --- Dummy Data ---
# Imagine a 10-class problem with only 50 training samples and 784 features
x_train = np.random.rand(50, 784).astype("float32")
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 10, 50)
x_test = np.random.rand(20, 784).astype("float32")
y_test = np.random.randint(0, 10, 20)
# ---

# 1. Initialize MothNet
# We need to tell it the number of classes for the readout layer.
mothnet = MothNet(num_classes=10, mb_units=2000)

# 2. Train MothNet with Hebbian learning
# This is a special training loop. Labels MUST be one-hot encoded.
y_train_onehot = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
mothnet.train_hebbian(x_train, y_train_onehot, epochs=5, verbose=0)
print("✅ MothNet trained with Hebbian learning!")

# 3. Create the augmented "cyborg" features
x_train_cyborg = create_cyborg_features(mothnet, x_train)
x_test_cyborg = create_cyborg_features(mothnet, x_test)
print(f"Original feature shape: {x_train.shape}")
print(f"Cyborg feature shape:   {x_train_cyborg.shape}") # Original + MothNet features

# 4. Train a standard SVM on the augmented data
svm = SVC()
svm.fit(x_train_cyborg, y_train)

# 5. Evaluate
accuracy = svm.score(x_test_cyborg, y_test)
print(f"\n✅ Cyborg SVM Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

## 8. Comprehensive Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standalone Classifier

While the cyborg approach is recommended, MothNet can be used as a standalone classifier after Hebbian training.

```python
# 1. Initialize and train MothNet as before
mothnet = MothNet(num_classes=10, mb_units=4000)
mothnet.train_hebbian(x_train, y_train_onehot, epochs=5)

# 2. Use the standard .predict() method to get logits
logits = mothnet.predict(x_test)
predictions = np.argmax(logits, axis=1)

# 3. Calculate accuracy
accuracy = np.mean(predictions == y_test)
print(f"Standalone MothNet Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

### Example 2: Extracting and Visualizing MB Sparse Codes

The sparse codes from the Mushroom Body are the "secret sauce" of MothNet. You can extract them for analysis.

```python
# After training...
mb_features = mothnet.extract_mb_features(x_test)
mb_features_numpy = keras.ops.convert_to_numpy(mb_features)

print(f"MB feature shape: {mb_features_numpy.shape}")

# Visualize the sparsity for the first sample
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 2))
plt.spy(mb_features_numpy[0:1, :], markersize=2)
plt.title("Mushroom Body Sparse Code (Sample 0)")
plt.xlabel("MB Neuron Index")
plt.show()
```

## 9. Training and Best Practices

-   **Use Hebbian Training**: MothNet is designed to be trained with the `train_hebbian` method. Standard `model.fit()` will not work correctly because the readout layer is not trainable by backpropagation.
-   **One-Hot Encode Labels**: The Hebbian learning rule requires target labels (`y_train`) to be one-hot encoded.
-   **Tune `mb_units`**: The degree of dimensional expansion in the Mushroom Body is the most important hyperparameter. A 20x to 50x expansion over the input dimension is a good starting point.
-   **Epochs**: Hebbian learning is very fast. Often, 1-10 epochs are sufficient to learn strong associations.
-   **Normalize Inputs**: Like most neural networks, MothNet performs best when input features are scaled to a standard range (e.g., [0, 1] or with a `StandardScaler`).

---

## 10. Serialization & Deployment

The `MothNet` model and all its custom layers are fully serializable using Keras 3's modern `.keras` format.

### Saving and Loading

```python
# Create and train model
mothnet = MothNet(num_classes=10, mb_units=2000)
mothnet.train_hebbian(x_train, y_train_onehot, epochs=5)

# Save the entire model to a single file
mothnet.save('my_mothnet_model.keras')

# Load the model, including custom layers, in a new session
loaded_model = keras.models.load_model('my_mothnet_model.keras')
print("✅ MothNet model loaded successfully!")
```

---

## 11. Testing & Validation

A `pytest` test to ensure the critical serialization cycle is robust.

```python
import pytest
import numpy as np
import keras
import tempfile
import os
from dl_techniques.models.mothnet.model import MothNet

def test_mothnet_serialization_cycle():
    """CRITICAL TEST: Ensures a model can be saved and loaded."""
    model = MothNet(num_classes=5, mb_units=100)
    dummy_input = np.random.rand(2, 20).astype("float32")
    
    # Hebbian training modifies weights, so we must run it
    dummy_labels = keras.utils.to_categorical(np.array([0, 1]), num_classes=5)
    model.train_hebbian(dummy_input, dummy_labels, epochs=1, verbose=0)
    
    original_prediction = model.predict(dummy_input)

    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        filepath = os.path.join(tmpdir, "test_model.keras")
        model.save(filepath)
        loaded_model = keras.models.load_model(filepath)

    loaded_prediction = loaded_model.predict(dummy_input)
    np.testing.assert_allclose(
        original_prediction, loaded_prediction, rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-5
    )
    print("✓ Serialization cycle test passed!")
```

## 12. Troubleshooting & FAQs

**Issue 1: My cyborg model isn't improving performance.**

-   **Cause**: The most likely cause is insufficient dimensional expansion in the Mushroom Body.
-   **Solution**:
    1.  **Increase `mb_units`**. This is the most critical parameter. Ensure it is at least 20x the dimension of your input data (after the AL layer).
    2.  Ensure your input data is normalized.
    3.  Experiment with the `mb_sparsity` (try values between 0.05 and 0.15).

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why not just use a big MLP?**

A: An MLP trained with backpropagation on very little data will almost certainly overfit. MothNet's architecture, with its fixed random projections and local Hebbian learning, acts as a powerful regularizer. It doesn't have enough trainable parameters to overfit easily, forcing it to find generalizable, robust features.

**Q: Can I train the whole network with backpropagation?**

A: You could set `trainable_projection=True` in the `MushroomBodyLayer` and `trainable=True` in the `HebbianReadoutLayer`, but this would defeat the purpose. The model's strength comes from its bio-mimetic, non-gradient-based learning principles. Training it with backprop would turn it into a standard, over-parameterized MLP that would perform poorly on small data.

**Q: Is MothNet a deep learning model?**

A: It's a "shallow" neural network that draws inspiration from neuroscience rather than statistical optimization. It belongs in the broader category of **bio-inspired AI** and is best seen as a tool to *enhance* deep learning or classical ML, not replace them.

## 13. Technical Details

### Why High-Dimensional Sparse Coding Works

The Mushroom Body's strategy is mathematically powerful for few-shot learning:

1.  **Separability (Cover's Theorem)**: A complex, non-linearly separable pattern in a low-dimensional space is highly likely to become linearly separable when projected into a sufficiently high-dimensional space. The MB's expansion is a practical application of this theorem.
2.  **Robustness**: Sparsity makes the codes robust. The identity of a pattern depends on *which* small set of neurons is active, not their precise analog values, making the representation resilient to noise.
3.  **Massive Capacity**: With `n` neurons and `k` active, there are `C(n, k)` possible patterns. For `n=4000` and `k=400`, this is `~10^459` unique codes—a colossal representational space.

### Hebbian Learning Formulation

The `HebbianReadoutLayer` updates its weights `W` using the rule:
`ΔW = α * (1/N) * Σ(x_i ⊗ y_i)`
where `α` is the learning rate, `N` is the batch size, `x_i` is the pre-synaptic MB code, and `y_i` is the post-synaptic one-hot label. The outer product `⊗` calculates the correlation between every MB neuron and every class neuron, strengthening connections that fire together.
