# CIFAR-10 Activation Function Comparison - Experimental Results Analysis

## Executive Summary

The experiment compared six activation functions on CIFAR-10 image classification: **ReLU**, **Tanh**, **GELU**, **Mish**, **SaturatedMish (α=1.0)**, and **SaturatedMish (α=2.0)**. Unlike MNIST, CIFAR-10 revealed significant performance differences between activation functions, with test accuracies ranging from 84.87% to 88.92% (4.05% spread). The increased complexity of natural images compared to handwritten digits makes activation choice considerably more impactful.

**Key Finding**: **Mish** achieved the highest test accuracy (88.92%), followed closely by **GELU** (88.71%). However, considering calibration metrics and training stability, **GELU** emerges as the most balanced choice with competitive accuracy, better calibration (lowest mean entropy of 0.0968), and consistent performance.

### 2. Model Calibration Analysis

Calibration metrics reveal prediction confidence reliability:

| Activation | ECE ↓ | Brier Score ↓ | Mean Entropy |
|------------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **Tanh** | **0.0836** | 0.2476 | 0.2337 |
| Sat_Mish_1 | 0.0900 | 0.2100 | 0.1181 |
| Mish | 0.0901 | 0.2096 | 0.0993 |
| Sat_Mish_2 | 0.0906 | 0.2222 | 0.1297 |
| GELU | 0.0908 | **0.2061** | **0.0968** |
| ReLU | 0.0989 | 0.2282 | 0.1251 |

**Key Observations:**
- Calibration is notably worse than MNIST (ECE ~0.09 vs ~0.003)
- **Tanh** paradoxically shows best ECE despite worst accuracy
- **GELU** achieves lowest Brier Score and mean entropy, indicating well-calibrated confident predictions
- **ReLU** shows the worst calibration (highest ECE)
- Higher mean entropy values suggest models are less confident on CIFAR-10's complex images

| Sat_Mish_2 | 87.67%       | 0.6992   | -0.0042             |
| ReLU       | 87.57%       | 0.7081   | -0.0126             |
| Sat_Mish_1 | 87.51%       | 0.7312   | -0.0012             |
| Tanh       | 84.82%       | 0.6783   | -0.0006             |

**Training Insights:**
- **Mish** shows excellent generalization with minimal gap (0.0009)
- Most models show negative gaps (test loss < val loss), suggesting slight underfitting
- **ReLU** has the largest negative gap, indicating potential for longer training
- Validation accuracies closely mirror test accuracies, confirming robust evaluation

## Conclusions

1. **Activation choice matters significantly for complex datasets** - CIFAR-10 reveals performance differences masked by MNIST's simplicity

2. **Modern activations (Mish, GELU) consistently outperform classics** on natural images, justifying their computational overhead

3. **GELU provides the best practical choice** for most applications, balancing accuracy, calibration, and widespread framework support

4. **SaturatedMish doesn't generalize well** to complex data, performing worse than standard Mish

5. **Tanh is unsuitable for modern computer vision** tasks, showing severe performance degradation

## Key Insights for Practitioners

1. **Dataset Complexity Amplifies Differences**: The 40x larger performance spread on CIFAR-10 vs MNIST demonstrates that activation choice becomes critical as task complexity increases

2. **Calibration Degrades with Complexity**: ECE increases ~30x from MNIST to CIFAR-10, highlighting the challenge of confident predictions on natural images

3. **Modern Activations Earn Their Complexity**: The 1-4% accuracy improvements of Mish/GELU over ReLU on CIFAR-10 can be decisive for production applications

## Future Research Directions

1. Evaluate on higher-resolution datasets (ImageNet) to confirm trends
2. Analyze activation functions with modern architectures (ResNets, Vision Transformers)

4. Investigate why SaturatedMish underperforms on complex data
5. Develop activation functions specifically optimized for natural image features
